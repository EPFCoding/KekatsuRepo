# EPF78's Kekatsu Repo

🎮 **The second Kekatsu repo to ever exist.**  
Welcome to my Kekatsu Repo!  
Here you'll find full DS / DSiWare ROMs — *basically hShop but for the DS*.  
_(WIP)_

---

## 📦 How do I add it?

1. Create a folder called `Kekatsu` in the **root of your SD card**.
2. Inside that folder, make a file named `databases.txt`.
3. Paste the following line into that file:
<pre>EPF78's Repo	https://gist.githubusercontent.com/EPFCoding/3cd7b96d9087ac32941f97348e8ee836/raw/</pre>
(Make sure to copy and paste it directly from here, since it has a special character that Kekatsu uses for some reason)

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a Work In Progress (WIP), things may break. _(and yes, I know it's slow asf but that's the DS side)_

> 📝 **Note:** This is a Self-Updating repo, so you don't need to redo the SD thing every time it updates.
