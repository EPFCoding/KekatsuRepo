# EPF78's Kekatsu Repo

🎮 **The second Kekatsu repo to ever exist.**  
Welcome to my Kekatsu Repo!  
Here you'll find full DS / DSiWare ROMs — *basically hShop but for the DS*.  
_(WIP)_

---

## 📦 How do I add it?

1. Create a folder called `Kekatsu` in the **root of your SD card**.
2. Inside that folder, make a file named `databases.txt`.
3. Paste the following line into that file:
<pre>EPF78's Repo	https://gist.githubusercontent.com/EPFCoding/3cd7b96d9087ac32941f97348e8ee836/raw/</pre>

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a Work In Progress (WIP), things may break. _(and yes, I know it's slow asf but that's the DS side)_
